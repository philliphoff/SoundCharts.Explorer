SoundCharts Explorer is a MacOS application for viewing nautical charts. Users can view "quilted" raster nautical charts (RNCs) from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), both offered online as well as by downloading chart "tilesets". (Quilted means showing the chart that best matches the current scale of the map.)

Future plans include viewing individual charts appropriately placed on the map.

## Use Disclaimer

SoundCharts Explorer is intended for reference purposes only and *not* suitable for marine navigation. RNCs are deprecated in the U.S. and are in the process of being deprecated in Canada, in favor of more modern electronic nautical charts (ENCs). Have smarts and use electronic charts!

## Installation and Use

> NOTE: SoundCharts Explorer relies on a backend service to return charts; currently that is not yet in place. However, those services can be run locally.
